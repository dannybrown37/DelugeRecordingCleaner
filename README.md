# DelugeRecordingCleaner

Tool to move unused recordings on a Synthstrom Deluge SD card to a 
separate folder called UNUSED RECORDINGS. 

NOTE: Files from the Deluge prior to firmware version 3 seem to cause
errors with this program as they use a multi-node XML format that 
breaks the parser I'm using.
